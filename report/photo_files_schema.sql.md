##  photo_files Table Schema Analysis 

The `photo_files` table stores basic information about photos on the device. Here's a breakdown of the schema:

* **_id:**  An integer representing the primary key, automatically incrementing for each photo record. This acts as a unique identifier for each photo.
* **height:**  An integer representing the height of the photo in pixels. 
* **width:** An integer representing the width of the photo in pixels. 
* **filesize:** An integer representing the size of the photo in bytes.

**Potential Hacker Actions:**

A hacker with root access could potentially:

* **Access all photo metadata:** They could retrieve the height, width, and file size of all photos stored on the device.
* **Identify potential targets:** Based on the file size and dimensions, they might be able to infer the type and potential content of the photos. 
* **Exfiltrate photo data:** The hacker could potentially copy the photos themselves from the device, depending on the security measures in place.

**Mitigation:**

To mitigate these risks, consider:

* **Encryption:** Encrypting photo storage can prevent hackers from accessing the raw photo data even if they have root access.
* **Access control:** Limiting access to photo directories can prevent unauthorized users from accessing photo files.
* **Regular security updates:** Keeping your device up-to-date with the latest security patches can help mitigate vulnerabilities that hackers might exploit. 

**Note:** This schema provides only basic information about photos. A more comprehensive analysis would require examining other relevant tables and their relationships.
