## Summary of `visible_contacts` table in `contact2.db`

The `visible_contacts` table in the `contact2.db` database appears to be a very simple table with only one column:

* **_id**: This column is of type `INTEGER` and is declared as the `PRIMARY KEY`. This indicates it is a unique identifier for each row in the table, likely representing a specific contact.

**Analysis:**

This table structure suggests that it might be used to store a list of contact IDs that are considered visible to the user.  Without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact purpose or how this table interacts with other tables in the database. 

**Security Implications:**

If a hacker gains root access to the device, they could potentially:

* **Read the `visible_contacts` table**:  This would allow the hacker to obtain a list of contact IDs that are considered visible to the user.
* **Modify the `visible_contacts` table**:  The hacker could potentially add or remove entries, altering the visibility of contacts.

**Recommendation:**

To mitigate security risks, it's important to understand how the `visible_contacts` table is used in conjunction with other tables.  Further analysis of the database schema and the associated application code is necessary to determine the full implications of the `visible_contacts` table and potential vulnerabilities.
