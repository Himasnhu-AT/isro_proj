## Analysis of `pre_authorized_uris` table in `contact2.db`

This table, `pre_authorized_uris`,  stores a list of pre-authorized URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) along with their expiration timestamps.  This information is likely used for applications that need to access external resources, possibly for authentication or data retrieval.

Here's a breakdown of the table's structure:

* **`_id`**:  An integer primary key that uniquely identifies each entry. It is auto-incremented, meaning a new ID is automatically assigned for each new URI entry.
* **`uri`**: A string column storing the URI itself. This is a crucial field as it represents the address of the external resource being authorized.
* **`expiration`**: An integer column storing the timestamp when the authorization for this URI will expire. It defaults to 0, implying that if not explicitly set, the authorization will likely never expire. 

**Security Implications:**

A hacker with root access to your device could potentially:

* **View pre-authorized URIs**: They can access this table and see all the external resources your applications are authorized to communicate with.
* **Modify expiration timestamps**:  They could change the expiration timestamps to either shorten or extend the authorization period for specific URIs, potentially affecting the security of sensitive data.
* **Add or remove entries**:  A malicious actor could add their own URIs to the table, allowing their applications to access your data or impersonate other applications.

**Recommendation:**

While the specific functionality of this table depends on the application using it, it is crucial to be aware of its potential security implications. It is recommended to regularly check and manage the entries in this table, ensuring only legitimate URIs with appropriate expiration times are included.
