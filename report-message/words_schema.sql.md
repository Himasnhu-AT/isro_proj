The `words` table appears to be a full-text search index built using SQLite's FTS3 extension. Let's break down the schema:

* **`_id` (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY):** This is a unique identifier for each entry in the table.
* **`index_text` (TEXT):** This column stores the actual text that is being indexed for searching.
* **`source_id` (INTEGER):**  This likely references an ID from another table, indicating the origin of the indexed text.
* **`table_to_use` (INTEGER):** This suggests that the indexed text comes from a specific table within the database, referenced by this ID.
* **`sub_id` (INTEGER):**  This could represent a sub-category or additional identifier related to the indexed text, potentially within the context of the table specified by `table_to_use`.

**What a Hacker Could Do:**

If a hacker has root access to your Android device and can access this database, they could potentially:

* **Search through your data:** By querying the `words` table, they could search for specific words or phrases across different tables within the database. This could reveal sensitive information depending on what data is stored in the indexed tables.
* **Gain insights into your activities:** The content of the indexed text could reveal information about your communication patterns, interests, and other habits. 
* **Potentially manipulate data:** If the attacker understands the relationship between the `words` table and the other tables, they could potentially modify data in the original tables based on their search results.

**Important Notes:**

* It's crucial to understand what tables are referenced by `source_id` and `table_to_use` to fully assess the security risks. 
* This schema alone does not provide specific details about the indexed text or the content of the tables being indexed. 

**Recommendation:**

To better assess the security implications, it's essential to analyze the structure and content of the tables linked to `source_id` and `table_to_use`. This will help you understand exactly what data is being indexed and what information a hacker could potentially access.
