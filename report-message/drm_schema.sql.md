##  Drm_schema.sql Summary

The `drm_schema.sql` table represents a very basic storage mechanism for DRM (Digital Rights Management) data. Here's a breakdown:

* **_id**:  This is the primary key, uniquely identifying each record in the table. It's an integer value.
* **_data**: This column stores the actual DRM data as text. This could include information like license keys, usage restrictions, or other content protection details. 
* **sub_id**: This integer column likely acts as a foreign key, referencing another table that might hold further details about the DRM data. The default value of -1 suggests this column may be optional.

**Possible Security Implications for a Hacker with Root Access:**

* **Accessing DRM Information:** A hacker with root access could potentially read the `_data` column to gain access to the DRM information stored in the database. This could be used to bypass content restrictions or exploit vulnerabilities in the DRM system.
* **Modifying DRM Data:**  The hacker could also modify the DRM data, potentially enabling unauthorized access to protected content.
* **Exploiting Sub-ID Relationship:**  Understanding the table referenced by the `sub_id` could reveal additional security vulnerabilities or sensitive data that could be exploited.

**Overall:**  While the `drm_schema.sql` table itself is simple, the data stored within the `_data` column could be quite sensitive. A hacker with root access could potentially compromise the DRM system by manipulating or accessing this data. Further analysis of the data within this table and the referenced `sub_id` table is necessary to fully assess the security risk.
